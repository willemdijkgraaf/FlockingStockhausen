# FlockingStockhausen
Experiment applying Stockhausen's principles of Points, Groups and Masses to flocking behavior.

Composition process based on adjusting parameters like
- amount of boids
- size of surface area
- how fast time passes (velocity of boids)
- bandwidth of the mass of boids
- bandwidth of the max velocity of boids
- ...
